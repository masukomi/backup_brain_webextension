# Backup Brain WebExtension

This is a Firefox & Chrome extension for easily adding links to [Backup Brain](https://backupbrain.app). 

## Installation 
[Install for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/backup_brain/)

or 

[Install for Chrome](https://example.com)

## Development

Firefox's Support of WebExtension v3 is pretty terrible, so we can't use the same plugin for Firefox & Chrome. 

As a result, the Firefox code can be found in the ~main~ branch and the Chrome code in the ~manifest_v3~ branch.

The Chrome code is a refinement of the Firefox code.
