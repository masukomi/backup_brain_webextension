# Backup Brain Browser Extensions

This repository contains the Chrome & Firefox extensions for the [Backup Brain](https://BackupBrain.app) Bookmarks Manager.

You can find the Chrome extension in the `chrome` branch, and the Firefox extension in the `firefox` branch.

The `chrome` branch is a refined manifest v3 version of the `firefox` branch. 

Please note that Browser Extensions are _not_ my fort√© and _any_ improvements will be appreciated. Even if it's just a trivial code-cleanup PR.
